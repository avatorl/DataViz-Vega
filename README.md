# Deneb-Vega data visualization examples

This repository contains source code and data for data visualizations created by Andrzej Leszkiewicz using Vega visualization language. The visualizations presented here can be be embedded into any Power BI report using Deneb custom visual, as well as they can be embedded directly into any web page.

Read more about [Deneb and Vega in Power BI](https://powerofbi.org/dataviz-galaxy-power-bi-deneb-vega/).

Each folder in this repository usually contains one visualization example: one Vega specification file (JSON) and at least one data file (CSV or JSON). Some examples may be presented in multiple variations and therefore more than one Vega specification file per folder.

See [live Deneb-Vega data visualization examples](https://powerofbi.org/deneb-vega-data-visualization-examples/) on my web site.
The visualiazations displayed there are being generated in real time using current version of the code and data files stored in this repository.

The visualizations shared in this repository are just showcases of Vega capabilities and results of author's experiments. Some of them may still require additional testing, debugging and code cleaning to be done. Feel free to create an Issue if you noticed any problem.
